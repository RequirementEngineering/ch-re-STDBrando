## Introduction
#### Purpouse
Design a system that allows the personal to ease the the way appointments are administrated in the clinic. Obtaining data, date of appointment, clinical trial to be done to the client, ect. As in the past they could only handle these situations with old methods by using paper and pens, writting every appointment.

The use of this system is intended to be used by the administrarive personal in the clinic that takes the role of attending the clients and creating the appointments and doing their desired clinical trials* in the specified date.
#### Scope
The system allows the employee to generate an appointment for a particular client by capturing his information.
The system should be able to generate a appointment for, first the clinic with information of the client cointaining basic and some personal information like, name, age, trial to be taken, may be another extra requirements needed depending of the clinical trial to be done; Second the client should obtain only the information about when to come for the trial to be attended by the doctor, as other information about the appointment.
A small database should be used to save the client, doctor, trial, etc. data
The system is intended to aid an speed up work performance of the administrative area of the clinic.

#### Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations
Some of the main concepts that are worked in the clinic,

| Term        | Definition           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Clinic     | Can be refer to a general medical practice, run by one or more general practitioners, but it could also mean a specialist clinic. Its a process oriented to a diagnostic like a disease, disorder, etc. |
| General practitioner      |   In the medical profession is consiered a medical doctor who treats acute an chronic illnesses and provides preventive care and health education.    |
| Clinical trial |   In a general sense it can be defined as physical, chemical or microbiologic studies that aids the diagnostic and medical treatment, and these practices are done by doing samples like urine, blood to investigate a posible abnormality.    |
| Laboratory | Its a place where a team of specialized members in the area like medics, analists, technical analists, do human biologic samples. |
| Patient | Usually will be the customer to take a clinic trial. |

The appendix will cointain information on the elicitacion and business process model.
## Overall Description

#### Product Perspective
This system consists of a independent application that will save information each one with customer, doctor, clinic trial information in a database.
Each time the employee has to create, modify or delete any of these elements, there will be a number of components in the interface so the system can communicate with the database and apply these changes.
#### Product Functions
Main actions that the system should perform:
* Create, modify and delete patient, doctor, user and clinic trial information.
* Manage information of the doctors in the clinic and patients assigned.
* Manage users (employee data and information) into system.
* Manage trial information (prices, trial available).
#### User characteristics
| User    | Details           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Employee | The employee will play the role of capturing customer data, also modifying any data. They will be also working with the doctor's data(add patients, add doctors, modify doctor information). The employee can be also considered as a regular user on the system. |
| Administrator   | The administrator of the system will play a greater role by modifying and adding trials, it will also take control of the users on the system that are the employees.  |
| Doctor | The doctor has a less important role in the process but just attend the client or know which clients took his trial. |
#### Constraints
- The employees in the clinic might not be experienced enough to use the system, so a little extra time is recommended to understand the use of the system.
- Its important for the employees and administrator to have their passwords at hand since with these they can access the system.
#### Assumptions and dependencies
* Assumptions
  - An Administrator should be able to modify all the data that the employee(user) can.
  - The user should be able to work only with creating patient information, adding or modifying doctor information.
  - One employee should be using the system at the time.
* Dependencies
  - The system should be running only on a windows OS.
## Specific requirements
The specific actions that the system shall do will be described in this section.
#### External interfaces
All the visual elements on the system will be described here, and how the system itself will look to the employee.
* Startup

    3. Date of birth
    4. Age 
    5. assigned trials
* Doctor tab
  - This screen features the doctors in a table available on the clinic
  - It contains the following elements:
    1. "Add" button
    2. "Edit" button
  - A table cointaining all the current doctors available will be shown with the following information
    1. Name
    2. Phone No.
    3. Email
    4. Address
    5. Assigned patients
* Trials tab
  - Only available for the administrators of the system
  - Features all the costs and available trials at the clinic in a table
  - The table contains the elements "Trial name" and "Price"
  - It contains two buttons:
    1. Add
    2. Edit
  - they can be modified in terms of prices and details
* User Tab
  - This screen features a table with details of all the current users and administrators in the system
  - Only the administrator is allowed to modify the information on this screen
  - It contains the following elements:
    1. "Add" button
    2. "Edit" button
  - The table features the sections:

  ## Appendix
  #### Elicitation process
The process followed to obtain the requirements of the system was to do an interview to the owner of the clinic. He wanted a system  capable of making the administrative apartment to be more efficient, since as time has passed the clinic has gotten more clients and he feels that the old methods that involved the use of pen and paper might not be enough.

    - How your employees work with customers to make appointments for them?
    - Are doctors also part of the process or they are just called out for what people to attend?
    - Is it only one employee using the system, or there are more than one at a time?
    - How much clients do you get per day?
    - Do your employees have any experience with computers, in the most basic level?

After the main questions were done, I’ve decided to reach a more open minded interview of what the client would want and I reached to the following conclusions:

* Conclusions
-	The client decided of a system based on tabs with these respective names: Patients, Doctors, Users, Trials (or also clinic trials)
-	The client requested that in most tabs, the employee should be able to change most information of a client, a doctor, check all clinical trials information (name, price, etc.)
-	The doctors do not have a big involvement in the process but to be aware of what clients he has, and when are the appointment dates that they should attend
-	The client wanted a simple user/administrator system where the administrator would be a specific
-	Since the way the system is looking it will be necessary to create a database where the patient, doctor, trial information will be stored
* Process
1. A patient requests a trial, first off the employee should fill up information on the client and save it, add his trial(s) in the patient history and the employee Will assign the patient to their respective doctor in the requested trial, the patient will be told to come until the next scheduled appointment.
Until the date of the scheduled appointment the patient will come to take his trial with the doctor and do the necessary studies to the patient, finally the employee will erase the patient information on the system unless the patient requested to take more than one trial in his history.
* Other
1. If a patient desires it he can request a change to his requested trial, for that the employee should only select the client information, and check his trial history and do the changes.
2. The employee can add and remove patients that a doctor will attend.
3. The administrator will be taking control of most of the system, adding and removing user data
4. The employee logs into the system, inputs his password and username, succefully logs in. In case not, the employee should reach the administrator to fix the issue.
